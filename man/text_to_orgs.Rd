\title{Match messy text data to social organizations using a 'funneling' method}
\usage{
text_to_orgs(data, id, input, output, sector)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or data frame extension (e.g. a tibble).}

\item{id}{A numeric or character vector unique to each entry.}

\item{input}{Character vector of messy or unstructured text that will
be unnested as n-grams and matched to dictionary of organizations in specified sector.}

\item{output}{Output column to be created as string or symbol.}

\item{sector}{Sector to match by organizations. Currently, the only option is "academic" 
with "business", "government", "household", and "nonprofit" in development.}
}
\description{
This function matches unstructured text data to various dictionaries of 
organizations by extracting and iterating through consecuetive word sequences 
(or n-grams). To do this, the function extracts n-grams using the tidytext 
package, matching all sequences in the unstructured data that have n words 
and then 'funneling' through all sequences of n-1, n-2, etc. words before 
matching the single tokens. This process returns a dataframe of ids, 
organizations, and sectors for only those rows matched within the sectors specified.
